#  This workflow runs when a tag is created with the `v` prefix or a push
#  to main occurs. It runs our validation script, outputs the artifact,
#  creates a new tag, Github release, and uploads/associates the artifact with the release.

# FIXME: We may need a different action for `Create new release tag` because
# it uses semantic commits to determine the version bump type and we presumably
