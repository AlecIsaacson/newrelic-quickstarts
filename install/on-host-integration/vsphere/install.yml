description: |
  The VMware vSphere on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your VMware vSphere environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the datacenter, cluster, host, datastore, and virtual machine levels.
  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
