  ## Why should you monitor your usage of Elastic KNN Search?
  Monitor your vector searches on Elastic KNN Search to get visibility on what you send to Elastic KNN Search, responses retrieved from Elastic KNN Search, latency, usage and errors. 

  ### Track the query performance of your Vector DB
  Track the behavior of your vector stores. Monitor the latency, queries, the number of documents retrieved, and the content of the documents so that you can evaluate their relevance.
 
  ### Track your app:  
  By tracking key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and input & output, you can gain insights into your app's performance and identify areas of improvement.
