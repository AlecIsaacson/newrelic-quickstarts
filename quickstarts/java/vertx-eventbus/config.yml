description: |
  # What is Vert.x?
  Vert.x is a reactive, event-driven application framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
  It's designed to build high-performance, scalable, and resilient applications with minimal resource 
  consumption. Vert.x provides a toolkit for building reactive and distributed systems, making it suitable
  for a wide range of use cases, including web applications, microservices, and IoT (Internet of Things)
  solutions. 

summary: |
  Provides instrumentation for monitoring the Vert.x Event Bus. Tracks flow across the event bus.
  Vertx-Verticles provides instrumentation for classes extends AbstractVerticle. It does this by 
  instrumenting each class that is deployed. 
  It tracks all methods except those defined by AbstractVerticle. 
  Methods not tracked: start, stop, rxStart, rxStop, config, deploymentID, getVertx, init, processArgs.
