  ## Why monitor your Keras app?
  Keras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Monitoring Keras is essential for maintaining the smooth operation of the system and ensuring the delivery of precise data insights.
  This necessity arises due to the following factors:
  ### Improve performance:
  Keras apps can be slow, especially for large models. By monitoring your app, you will be able to identify areas where performance can be improved.
  ### Model Health: 
  Keep track of the model's health and reliability over time to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
  ### Data Quality: 
  Monitor data preprocessing and input quality to maintain the integrity of model inputs.
