  ## Why monitor LangChain?
  LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. New Relic LangChain quickstart performance monitoring offers immediate and pre-configured observability.
  By using the LangChain quickstart, you will be able to:
  ### Ensure uptime: 
  LangChain AI is a complex system, and it is important to make sure that it is always up and running. By monitoring the system, you will quickly identify and fix any issues that may cause downtime.
  ### Track performance:  
  Monitoring the performance of LangChain AI will help you identify areas where you will improve. For example, you will track things like latency, throughput, and error rates.
  ### Improve the model: 
  Monitoring the performance of LangChain AI allows for the identification of areas where the model can be improved. For example, tracking the accuracy of the model's predictions and the diversity of the model's responses.
  
  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for LangChain
  Our LangChain quickstart provides metrics, including uptime, accuracy, relevance, and speed. These metrics serve as valuable tools to empower you in maximizing the performance of LangChain AI.
