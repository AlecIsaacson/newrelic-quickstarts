  ## Why monitor LangChain?
  LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. New Relic LangChain quickstart performance monitoring offers immediate and pre-configured observability.
  By using the LangChain quickstart, you will be able to:
  ### Ensure uptime: 
  LangChain AI is a complex system, and it is important to make sure that it is always up and running. By monitoring the system, you will quickly identify and fix any issues that may cause downtime.
  ### Track performance:  
  By tracking key metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates, you can gain insights into LangChain AI's performance and identify areas of improvement.
  ### Improve the model: 
  Monitoring the performance of LangChain AI allows for the identification of areas where the model can be improved. For example, tracking the accuracy of the model's predictions and the diversity of the model's responses.
