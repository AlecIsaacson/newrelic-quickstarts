  ## Why should you monitor PyTorch?
  PyTorch is an open source machine learning library used for developing and training neural network based deep learning models. New Relic PyTorch quickstart performance monitoring offers immediate and pre-configured observability.
  By using the PyTorch quickstart, you will be able to:
  ### Identify performance bottlenecks: 
  Monitoring PyTorch can help you identify performance bottlenecks. This can help you improve the performance of your PyTorch by optimizing the code.
  ### Ensure output quality:
  PyTorch is a powerful tool for deep learning, but it can be difficult to ensure that the output of your models is accurate and reliable. By monitoring your PyTorch, you will identify any problems with the output and take steps to correct them.
  ### Detecting errors: 
  Monitoring PyTorch can help you detect errors. This can help you fix the errors and prevent them from happening again.
  ### Preventing outages: 
  Monitoring PyTorch can help you prevent outages. This can be done by monitoring the health of the PyTorch and taking action if any problems are detected.
